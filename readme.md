# Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization of Crypto Assets with Pymoo

This project applies the principles of multi-objective optimization to create optimal crypto asset portfolios based on maximizing returns and minimizing risks. The project uses the Python library Pymoo for multi-objective optimization and Plotly.js for data visualization.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a quantitative method for creating diverse portfolios of crypto assets that balance the trade-off between risk and return.

## Setup and Requirements

This project uses Python 3.8 and requires the following libraries:
- numpy
- pymoo
- plotly

To install these libraries, use pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pymoo plotly
```

## How to Run

To run the optimization, navigate to the project's root directory and run:

```bash
python optimize.py
```

The script will print the optimization progress and display a scatter plot of the Pareto-front solutions at the end. Each point in the scatter plot represents a portfolio, with the x-coordinate showing the negative return (since the problem was formulated as a minimization problem), and the y-coordinate showing the risk.

## Further Information

This is a simplified model and does not take into account factors like transaction costs and time dependencies. Use the results as a basis for further investigation, not as definitive financial advice.

## Contribution

This project is open-source and we welcome any feedback. If you have any suggestions or you want to see improvements, feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
